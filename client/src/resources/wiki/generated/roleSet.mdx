## About Role Sets

Role sets help organize roles based on their alignment and purpose in the game:

- **Town**: Work together to eliminate threats
- **Syndicate**: Work together to eliminate town
- **Neutral**: Have unique win conditions
- **Cult**: Work together with cult-specific mechanics
- **Fiends**: Independent threat roles
- **Minions**: Win when town loses

Each role belongs to one or more role sets, which determines their default alignment and teammates.
