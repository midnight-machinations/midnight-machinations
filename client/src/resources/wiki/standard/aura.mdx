Aura is an investigative result that certain roles appear to have when checked by investigative roles. A player's aura can be either **Innocent** or **Suspicious**.

## Aura Types

### Innocent Aura
Players with innocent aura appear as town-aligned to investigative checks. This makes them seem trustworthy.

::: tip
Having an innocent aura doesn't necessarily mean a player IS town - some evil roles have innocent aura to deceive investigators!
:::

### Suspicious Aura
Players with suspicious aura appear as potential threats to investigative checks.

::: warning For Investigators
Don't immediately trust aura results! Some town roles have suspicious aura, and some evil roles have innocent aura.
:::

## How Aura Works

When an investigative role checks a player's aura:

1. The investigator performs their action
2. They receive a result based on the target's current aura
3. The result is sent to the investigator at the end of the night

## Aura Manipulation

Some roles and abilities can affect aura:

- **Temporary Changes**: Some abilities can temporarily change a player's aura
- **Role-Based**: Most roles have a fixed aura determined by their alignment
- **Conditional**: The [Godfather](role/godfather) loses their innocent aura when roleblocked

## Examples

### Roles with Innocent Aura
- Most Town roles (default)
- [Godfather](role/godfather) - Special case: has innocent aura unless blocked

### Roles with Suspicious Aura
- Most Syndicate roles
- Certain Neutral roles
- Some Town roles for balance purposes

::: info Game Design
The aura system adds complexity to investigation, preventing simple mechanical solutions and encouraging discussion and deduction.

## Strategic Tips

### For Investigators

### For Evil Roles with Innocent Aura
- Use your innocent aura claim as cover
- Be ready to fake-claim a town role
- Don't act too suspicious despite your cover

### For Town with Suspicious Aura
- Establish trust early through actions
- Be transparent about your suspicious aura
- Use your suspicion to draw out evil attacks
