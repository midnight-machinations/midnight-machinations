# {title}

During the day, as long as you can speak in all chat, you can whisper to any other living player:

- Whispering sends a private chat message to the player you chose
- To whisper someone, use the whisper command or open the whisper channel using the button in the playerlist
  - The whisper command is `\w#` where `#` is replaced with the player number of the player you want to whisper, so `\w2 Hey, my role is witch!` whispers to player @2
- When you whisper someone, a message is sent in all chat saying that you whispered to the player you chose, so everyone knows that you whispered that player
  - You can't whisper to an enfranchised player
  - If you try to send an invalid whisper you are sent a chat message saying that you can't whisper.

## Tips

::: tip Strategic Use
Whispers can be used to coordinate with other players privately, but remember that everyone can see **who** you whispered to, even if they can't see the content.
