Tags are temporary markers that can be placed on players to track various game states and effects. Different roles and abilities interact with tags in unique ways.

## How Tags Work

Tags are applied to players and typically last for one night or until a specific condition is met. They are invisible to the tagged player but may be visible to certain roles.

::: info
Tags do not directly affect a player's abilities unless a specific role or modifier interacts with them.
