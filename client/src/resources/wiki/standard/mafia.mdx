The syndicate hierarchy is the system which keeps the syndicate being able to kill every night. The syndicate hierarchy is a collection of players who are syndicate insiders and usually syndicate loyalists. The system follows two rules:

* If there is a Syndicate Killing role in the hierarchy - such as [Godfather](role/godfather) or [Impostor](role/impostor) - when they die, another member of the hierarchy inherits their role.
* If there is no Syndicate Killing role in the hierarchy, a syndicate member is given the [syndicate gun](standard/syndicateGun). When the player with the syndicate gun dies, another member of the hierarchy inherits it.

Players that are in the syndicate hierarchy tend to also be syndicate insiders and loyalists. This means they win by eliminating every other team and can talk together during night and obituary.
