Defense is a protective attribute that some roles possess, allowing them to survive attacks that would normally kill them.

## Defense Levels

### Armored Defense
The most common form of defense. Players with armor can survive one basic attack per night.

::: tip
Armor only protects against direct attacks. It doesn't protect against other forms of death like execution or special abilities.
:::

### How Armor Works

When a player with armor is attacked:

1. The attack is blocked
2. The armor is consumed for that night
3. The player receives a message about being attacked
4. The armor regenerates at the start of the next night

::: warning Multiple Attacks
If a player is attacked multiple times in one night, only one armor charge is consumed. However, powerful attacks may bypass armor entirely.
:::

## Attack vs Defense

Different attacks have different strengths:

- **Basic Attack**: Blocked by armor
- **Powerful Attack**: Bypasses armor
- **Unstoppable Attack**: Cannot be blocked by any defense

## Roles with Defense

Several roles start with armor or can gain it through their abilities:

- [Godfather](role/godfather) - Has permanent armor
- Various Town roles may have conditional armor
- Some roles can grant armor to other players

::: note
Check individual role pages for specific defense information.
